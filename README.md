# Galaxy Image Analysis and Detection of Black Holes

This project focuses on analysing galaxy images using image processing techniques. We applied filters like Sato and Meijering to different scales of the images to identify distinct features. Our findings suggest the presence of black holes at the core of galaxies.


### Project Overview
Used Sato and Meijering filters to analyse galaxy images.
Examined images at wide, zoomed, and nucleus scales.
Observed distinct features indicating the presence of black holes.
Utilised density functions, spectrograms, and line plots for further analysis.

### Results and Observations
Identified two distinct objects at the core, likely black holes.
Density function plots showed two peaks, indicating the presence of black holes.
Spectrograms exhibited similar intensity patterns associated with black holes.
Line plots confirmed the presence of two black holes, one larger than the other.
